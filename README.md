# The Wall 
Based on https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter.git

# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need a few things:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Getting started
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/status-on-the-wall/the-wall-nodejs
```
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.
Below is a list of all the scripts this template has available:


| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                 |
| `build`                   | Full build. Runs ALL build tasks (`build-sass`, `build-ts`, `tslint`, `copy-static-assets`)       |
| `serve`                   | Runs node on `dist/server.js` which is the apps entry point                                       |
| `watch-node`              | Runs node with nodemon so the process restarts if it crashes. Used in the main watch task         |
| `watch`                   | Runs all watch tasks (TypeScript, Sass, Node). Use this if you're not touching static assets.     |
| `test`                    | Runs tests using Jest test runner                                                                 |
| `build-ts`                | Compiles all source `.ts` files to `.js` files in the `dist` folder                                 |
| `watch-ts`                | Same as `build-ts` but continuously watches `.ts` files and re-compiles when needed                |
| `build-sass`              | Compiles all `.scss` files to `.css` files                                                          |
| `watch-sass`              | Same as `build-sass` but continuously watches `.scss` files and re-compiles when needed            |
| `tslint`                  | Runs TSLint on project files                                                                       |
| `copy-static-assets`      | Calls script that copies JS libs, fonts, and images to dist directory                             |
| `debug`                   | Performs a full build and then serves the app in watch mode                                       |
| `serve-debug`             | Runs the app with the --inspect flag                                                               |
| `watch-debug`             | The same as `watch` but includes the --inspect flag so you can attach a debugger                  |

### Running tests
Simply run `npm run test`.
Note this will also generate a coverage report.

### Writing tests
Writing tests for web apps has entire books dedicated to it and best practices are strongly influenced by personal style, so I'm deliberately avoiding discussing how or when to write tests in this guide.
However, if prescriptive guidance on testing is something that you're interested in, [let me know](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LN2CV82), I'll do some homework and get back to you.

## TSLint
TSLint is a code linter which mainly helps catch minor code quality and style issues.
TSLint is very similar to ESLint or JSLint but is built with TypeScript in mind.

### TSLint rules
Like most linters, TSLint has a wide set of configurable rules as well as support for custom rule sets.
All rules are configured through `tslint.json`.
In this project, we are using a fairly basic set of rules with no additional custom rules.
The settings are largely based off the TSLint settings that we use to develop TypeScript itself.

### Running TSLint
Like the rest of our build steps, we use npm scripts to invoke TSLint.
To run TSLint you can call the main build script or just the TSLint task.
```
npm run build   // runs full build including TSLint
npm run tslint  // runs only TSLint
```
Notice that TSLint is not a part of the main watch task.
It can be annoying for TSLint to clutter the output window while in the middle of writing a function, so I elected to only run it only during the full build.
If you are interesting in seeing TSLint feedback as soon as possible, I strongly recommend the [TSLint extension in VS Code]().
